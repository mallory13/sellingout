                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>Our family purchased two of the inflatable airis SUPs and have used them in both ocean and lakes. They
                        are easy to inflate and as hard as a regular board, lightweight and easy to transport too </p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <p> Inflates quickly, can support two people plus dog! Nice built in velcro paddle straps and elastics to
                        secure your gear </p>
                    <h4> Cons: </h4> Nothing Usage: Use 100% recreational as both SUP or kayak</p>
                </section>

                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>Lightweight and very portable – these are the two most obvious attributes of this inflatable board. However,
                        this board is also extremely stable, tracks very well and performs as well as any rigid board I have
                        ever used in my four years of stand up paddle boarding. </p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <p>It is portable, light-weight and performs as well as any rigid board. </p>
                    <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes, inflating the to correct PSI can be difficult. Usage: It is used for exercise and touring.
                        We use is on cottage lakes as well as on Lake Ontario. </p>

                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>The TOUR 12.5 is built for speed and performance. The longer water line and subtle rocker on this board
                        mean it is quick on the water. It glides easily and there is no flex unlike other inflatable boards
                        and comes with bungee tie downs for gear </p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <p>The ability to switch to sit-down paddling provides a lot of versatility, making it a great board for
                        family members with different paddling styles. Best uses are on calm waters and slow moving rivers.
                        And if it gets too hot out in the sun, it’s easy to slide into the water and climb back on board,
                        or use it as a diving/jumping platform. </p>
                    <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <p>FUN</p>
                    <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <p>NONE. </p>
